World Food Prices Exploration App
=================================

Created for Oxfam during the DataKind UK DataDive, London, July 2013.

A dashboard for exploring food prices. One version uses detailed Kenya data, and another shows data for other countries (these could be combined easily but come from different source files).

DATA
----

Cleaned world food prices csv, transformed from https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Byx-eDAJ0D8-ZVROeTNzLVNVM1k&amp;usp=sharing

The scripts to clean and transform this data can be found in processData.R - written by Derek.

The apps can be started using either runCountryApp.R or runKenyaApp.R, and these should automatically load a browser window showing the applications.

Please do contact me if any further information or modifcations are required.
